# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in this exception.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.java`, addresses the issue by ensuring that all array accesses are within the bounds of the array's valid indices.

This example is useful for understanding array boundaries and avoiding this common runtime error in Java programs.
